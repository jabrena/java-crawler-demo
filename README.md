## Conclusion

All crawlers share the same public API and produce the same `CrawlResult` structure, making them interchangeable from a client perspective. The choice between them depends on your specific requirements, with performance being a critical factor based on JMH benchmark results:

### üèÜ **Performance Leaders (Based on Latest JMH Results - 2025-01-09)**
- **Choose Structured Worker (v9)** for **maximum performance** (464.61 ms/op) with modern Java 25 structured concurrency and virtual threads
- **Choose Multi-threaded Iterative (v4)** for **near-optimal performance** (482.59 ms/op) with efficient iterative processing and excellent stability
- **Choose Producer-Consumer (v2)** for **excellent performance** (495.82 ms/op) with clear separation of concerns and proven scalability

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Balanced Options**
- **Choose Virtual Thread Actor (v10)** for solid performance (500.36 ms/op) with simplified async processing and virtual thread-based actors
- **Choose Actor (v5)** for solid performance (514.10 ms/op) with fault-tolerant, distributed systems and message-driven concurrency
- **Choose Sequential (v1)** for solid performance (709.23 ms/op) with simplicity, predictability, and smaller crawling tasks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Concerns**
- **Avoid Structural Concurrency (v7)** - Poor performance (1816.83 ms/op - 3.9x slower than best) with significant overhead
- **Avoid Recursive Actor (v6)** - Poor performance (1709.19 ms/op - 3.7x slower than best) with high variance
- **Avoid Hybrid Actor-Structural (v8)** - Poor performance (1518.68 ms/op - 3.3x slower than best) with significant overhead

### üÜï **New Implementation**
- **Virtual Thread Actor (v10)** - Successfully benchmarked with excellent performance (500.36 ms/op - 4th place). Delivers on its promise of simplified async processing with virtual threads and better resource utilization compared to v5. Uses virtual thread-based actors for lightweight concurrency with supervisor pattern for fault tolerance.

### üìä **Key Performance Insights**
1. **Virtual threads** (v9) achieve the best performance with modern Java 25 structured concurrency
2. **Traditional Java concurrency** (ThreadPoolExecutor, BlockingQueue) continues to excel in performance and stability
3. **Virtual Thread Actor (v10)** successfully delivers on its promise of simplified async processing with excellent performance (4th place)
4. **Actor model** (v5) remains competitive with fault-tolerant, distributed systems
5. **Recursive Actor approaches** (v6) show significant performance degradation in recent benchmarks
6. **Hybrid approaches** (v7, v8) introduce complexity without performance benefits
7. **Virtual threads** demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional threading models
