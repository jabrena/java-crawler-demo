# Jox-based Structured Concurrency Crawler (v12)

## Core Concept

The Jox-based Structured Concurrency Crawler implements **SoftwareMill's Jox library** for supervised scopes, addressing the SoftwareMill critique of JEP 505 by providing a programmer-friendly API for structured concurrency. It uses `supervised()` scopes with `forkCancellable()` and built-in timeout mechanisms to provide better control, clearer semantics, and automatic resource management.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - The client creates a crawler specifying max depth, max pages, and timeout settings
   - Thread-safe collections manage shared state for coordination
   - Virtual threads provide efficient concurrency without thread pool overhead

2. **Jox Supervised Scope Architecture**:
   - **Supervised Scopes**: `supervised()` creates supervised scopes with automatic supervision
   - **Cancellable Forks**: `forkCancellable()` provides individual task cancellation support
   - **Clear Semantics**: `Fork.join()` provides clear blocking behavior (unlike `Subtask.get()`)
   - **Automatic Interruption**: Supervisor handles scope body interruption
   - **User vs Daemon Forks**: Control which forks must complete

3. **Recursive Processing with Jox Scopes**:
   - The main crawl operation creates a `supervised()` scope
   - For each URL, the crawler recursively processes it within the scope
   - For discovered links, child scopes are created for parallel processing
   - Each scope manages its own set of concurrent subtasks with cancellation support
   - Automatic cleanup occurs when scopes close

4. **Supervisor Pattern with Jox**:
   - Scope body runs in separate virtual thread (supervisor pattern)
   - Automatic supervision and cleanup by Jox
   - Better error handling than JEP 505 StructuredTaskScope
   - Uniform cancellation across all tasks

5. **Result**: Returns a `CrawlResult` with pages, failures, and performance statistics.

## Key Characteristics

- **Jox Supervised Scopes**: Uses SoftwareMill's Jox library for structured concurrency
- **Cancellable Forks**: Individual task cancellation support with `forkCancellable()`
- **Clear Semantics**: `Fork.join()` provides clear blocking behavior
- **Automatic Supervision**: Scope body runs in separate virtual thread with automatic supervision
- **Better Error Handling**: Automatic cleanup and better error propagation than JEP 505
- **Virtual Thread Efficiency**: Efficient concurrency without thread pool overhead
- **Natural Tree Structure**: Recursive scoping matches web topology
- **Modern Java Features**: Leverages Jox's improvements over JEP 505

## Jox Advantages over JEP 505

### 1. Supervised Scopes
**JEP 505 Problem**: Scope body doesn't participate in error handling mechanisms of subtasks.

**Jox Solution**:
- Scope body runs in separate virtual thread (supervisor pattern)
- Automatic supervision and cleanup
- Better error handling than JEP 505
- Uniform cancellation across all tasks

### 2. Cancellable Forks
**JEP 505 Problem**: Limited control over individual task cancellation.

**Jox Solution**:
- `forkCancellable()` provides individual task cancellation support
- Better control than standard forks
- Clean cancellation propagation
- More granular control over task lifecycle

### 3. Clear Fork Semantics
**JEP 505 Problem**: `Subtask.get()` has different semantics than `Future.get()` (non-blocking vs blocking).

**Jox Solution**:
- `Fork.join()` provides clear blocking behavior
- Natural blocking semantics
- No confusion with `Future.get()`
- Clear completion semantics

### 4. User vs Daemon Forks
**JEP 505 Problem**: Limited control over which tasks must complete.

**Jox Solution**:
- `forkUser()` for required tasks
- `fork()` for background tasks
- Better control than JEP 505
- More flexible task management

## Architecture Pattern

The Jox-based approach implements **Supervised Scopes** with cancellable forks:

```java
supervised(scope -> {
    // Scope body runs in separate virtual thread (supervisor pattern)
    var mainTask = scope.forkCancellable(() -> {
        crawlWithJoxSupervisedScope(seedUrl, 0);
    });
    
    // Clear blocking semantics
    mainTask.join();
});

function crawlWithJoxSupervisedScope(url, depth):
    if depth > maxDepth: return
    if pagesCrawled >= maxPages: return
    
    page ‚Üê fetch(url)
    results.add(page)
    
    if depth < maxDepth:
        supervised(childScope -> {
            for link in page.links:
                // Cancellable forks for individual task cancellation
                var childTask = childScope.forkCancellable(() -> {
                    crawlWithJoxSupervisedScope(link, depth + 1);
                });
                childTasks.add(childTask);
            
            // Clear blocking semantics
            for (var childTask : childTasks) {
                childTask.join();
            }
        });
```

Key insight: Jox's supervised scopes provide automatic supervision, cancellable forks, and clear semantics, addressing all major critiques of JEP 505 while maintaining the benefits of structured concurrency.
