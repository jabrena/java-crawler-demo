# Web Crawler Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the eight different web crawler implementations in this project. Each approach solves the same problem‚Äîcrawling web pages starting from a seed URL‚Äîbut uses fundamentally different architectural patterns and concurrency models.

## Conclusion

All eight crawlers share the same public API and produce the same `CrawlResult` structure, making them interchangeable from a client perspective. The choice between them depends on your specific requirements, with performance being a critical factor based on JMH benchmark results:

### üèÜ **Performance Leaders (Based on JMH Results)**
- **Choose Multi-threaded Recursive (v4)** for **maximum performance** (500.26 ms/op) with stack-safe deep recursion and excellent stability
- **Choose Producer-Consumer (v2)** for **near-optimal performance** (503.65 ms/op) with clear separation of concerns and proven scalability
- **Choose Actor (v5)** for **good performance** (557.70 ms/op) with fault-tolerant, distributed systems and message-driven concurrency

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Balanced Options**
- **Choose Sequential (v1)** for simplicity, predictability, and smaller crawling tasks (765.22 ms/op - 4th place)
- **Choose Recursive (v3)** for elegant functional programming and deep recursion without stack overflow (816.36 ms/op - 5th place)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Concerns**
- **Avoid Recursive Actor (v6)** - Poor performance (1873.83 ms/op - 3.7x slower than best) with high variance
- **Avoid Hybrid implementations (v7, v8)** - Structural Concurrency (1570.43 ms/op) and Hybrid Actor-Structural (1703.47 ms/op) show significant overhead

### üìä **Key Performance Insights**
1. **Traditional Java concurrency** (ThreadPoolExecutor, BlockingQueue) outperforms modern alternatives
2. **Actor model overhead** can be significant for I/O-bound tasks like web crawling
3. **Hybrid approaches** introduce complexity without performance benefits
4. **Structural concurrency** (Java 21+) needs optimization for this use case

### üéØ **Production Recommendations**
- **Primary Choice**: Multi-threaded Recursive (v4) - Best performance, stability, and proven patterns
- **Alternative**: Producer-Consumer (v2) - Excellent performance with cleaner architecture
- **Special Cases**: Actor (v5) for distributed systems requiring fault tolerance

Each implementation offers unique tradeoffs between simplicity, performance, fault tolerance, and programming paradigm. The JMH results reveal that **performance doesn't always correlate with architectural complexity** - the most complex implementations (v6, v7, v8) actually perform worse than simpler alternatives. This demonstrates the importance of empirical performance testing when choosing architectural patterns for production systems.

## Architecture Evolution

The project demonstrates how the same problem can be solved with different architectural patterns and concurrency models:

- **v1**: Simple iterative approach with queue-based BFS
- **v2**: Multi-threaded producer-consumer pattern for parallel processing
- **v3**: Functional programming with trampoline pattern for stack-safe recursion
- **v4**: Hybrid approach combining parallel processing with stack-safe recursion
- **v5**: Actor model with message passing for fault-tolerant distributed systems
- **v6**: Hybrid actor-recursive model with dynamic spawning for natural tree structures
- **v7**: Java 25's structural concurrency with automatic resource management and virtual threads
- **v8**: Hybrid actor-structural concurrency combining actor coordination with automatic resource management for maximum fault tolerance
